# FitX tracker (iOS)

**TL;DR: An app that helps me keep track of my workout progress**

I am not familiar with any of the workout terminology, and all I want to do is to keep track of
- which machine
- weight
- reps
- sets

So that I will keep improving, instead of just picking some random machine & weight that I am
comfortable with.
